# Creating Your First BR File

Welcome to the BR Language Extension! Let's start by creating a Business Rules! source file.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new file** with a `.brs` extension
2. **Try typing** some basic BR code to see syntax highlighting in action

## Sample Code to Try

Copy and paste this simple BR program:

```br
! My First BR Program
print "Hello, Business Rules!"

let x = 42
let name$ = "BR Developer"

print "Number: "; x
print "Name: "; name$

for i = 1 to 5
    print "Count: "; i
next i
```

## What You'll Notice

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Keywords like `print`, `let`, `for` are highlighted
- **File Recognition**: VS Code automatically recognizes `.brs` files as BR language
